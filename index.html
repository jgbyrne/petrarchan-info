        <h2>Petrarchan is offline</h2>
        <p>
        <b>Update: we are back online now. Hard-refresh petrarchan.com to get back to the normal site</b>
        <br/>
        This is not because of my shoddy administration skills or because we've been hacked by soyteens, it's because of our useless french web host OVH, who have accidentally dropped an entire datacentre offline.
        <br/><br/>
        Typical French.
        <br/><br/>
        Hopefully back soon!
